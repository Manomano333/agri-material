  <p>Production of fruits and vegetables in the country may fall up to 30% this season as farmers report damages to their crop due to high temperatures amid the ongoing flowering and fruiting process.</p>

<pre>While mango farmers have already reported massive flower and fruit drop, the sudden and early onset of summer will also adversely affect lychee, citrus fruits, watermelons, bananas, and cashew crops, experts said. Vegetables like cabbage, cauliflowers, leafy vegetables, and tomatoes will not only be of lower size but of lower nutritional content, they said.

"We estimate that there will be a loss of 10% to 30% for different fruit and vegetable crops in different regions due to the sudden increase in temperatures," said SK Singh, director of Indian Institute of Horticulture Research (IIHR), Bengaluru. "The fruit crops that are immediately affected are mangoes, lychee, citrus crops like kinnow and oranges, bananas and avocados."

Production of high-value Alphonso mangoes in Maharashtra is likely to be hit by about 40%, farmers said.

Crop scientists said high heat coupled with higher humidity has increased pest and fungus infestation.

Normally, temperatures increase gradually around the Holi festival, which falls on March 8 this year. However, this time, the temperature started soaring immediately after the winter.

Last month was the hottest February on record for the country with the average maximum temperature at 29.5 degrees Celsius.</pre>
